// main class
// main program logic
// decides what to do when the user makes a selection; for example, saves an entry, loads an entry
// Implement a menu system that allows users to choose different options: writing a new entry, displaying entries, saving to a file, and loading from a file.
// How do implement this menu system?
// Implement methods for each menu option. For example, when the user chooses to write a new entry, display a random prompt, take user input for the response, and create a new journal entry object.
// How do I implement these methods?
// Implement methods for saving and loading journal entries to and from a text file. You can use StreamWriter for writing to a file and StreamReader for reading from a file.
// How do I implement these methods? What is StreamWriter? How do I use it?
// When saving, consider how you want to format the data in the file (e.g., comma-separated values, JSON, etc.). For simplicity, you can use a delimiter like "|" to separate different parts of an entry.
// How do I find out what format the data should be? I will use | as suggested, but how?
// When loading, parse the file content and reconstruct journal entry objects.
// How do I parse the file content and reconstruct journal entry objects?
// Test your program thoroughly to ensure that it works as expected. Test all menu options, writing entries, displaying entries, saving, and loading.
// Ok. I will do this
// Handle edge cases gracefully, such as when the user tries to load from a file that doesn't exist.
// Ok. I suspect I will need to display a graceful prompt explaining what happened.
// Add comments to your code explaining complex logic, especially if it's not immediately obvious what a particular section of code does.
// Ok
// Include comments describing how your classes and methods work.
// Ok
// If you want to exceed the requirements, think of additional features you can add to your journal app. For example, you could allow users to edit or delete entries, add tags to entries, or search for specific entries based on keywords.
// How do I allow users to edit or delete entries?
// How do I allow users to add tags to entries?
// How do I allow users to search for specific entries based on keywords?
// Document any extra features you implement in your comments.
// Ok
// Make sure your code is well-organized, commented, and easy to understand.
// Ok
// Submit your assignment through the specified method, whether it's via an online platform or by sharing a GitHub repository link.
// I will probably submit it through GitHub
